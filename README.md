# JQeury Server Calculator


## Description

This is a minimalist calculator program made using:

Javascript
jQuery
Bootstrap
Express

This calculator takes in two numbers and one operator and returns the solution on click of the = button. The user must input two numbers and one operator to recieve a solution. A clear button clears the inputs. A history of all calculations with solutions is displayed on the DOM when the = button is clicked.

This program takes the information entered by the user (two numbers and an operator), bundles it as an object, and sends it to server. The server calculates the solution, attaches the solution to the object, and pushes the object into an array stored on the server. The client.js then requests the array to display on the DOM.
